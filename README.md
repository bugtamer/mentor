Not only allows to optimize the study time and reduce the **Forgetting Curve** by using **Active Recall** and **Spaced Repetition** techniques, but also makes learning more enjoyable and less painfully than *cramming*.

- **Active Recall** consists in compeling your memory to think of, remember or solve something in a clear context.

- **Forgetting Curve** refers to the natural and gradual decline of memory retention over time and was discovered in 1885 by Hermann Ebbinghaus.

- **Spaced Repetition** is review the material close to the time you probably forget it due to the Forgetting Curve. This implies you should review more often the material you are unfamiliar with and less frequently those one you know better.
